# Langchain GPT

Langchain is used to create LLM applications. Think of it as `rails new` or
`npx create-next-app`. Then one goes about adding other components like a
prompt, LLM of choice and so on. Langchain provides a lot of other things
as well. It would be nice to have a GPT dedicated to answer questions w.r.t
organizing Langchain code and provide insights.
