# Single Purpose GPTs

It would be nice to have GPTs which can serve one and only one purpose. Some of
the ideas that come to mind are:

- A GPT which can manage access to Github
- A GPT which can manage access to Gitlab
- A GPT which can manage access to Slack

There might already be some GPTs out there which can help with these tasks. The
beauty of these GPTs is that we can publish them and tie them together to bring
structure to tedious tasks that a company does.
