# Generators with Hotwire

Hotwire is a way to write better apps using Rails. It does all the heavy lifting
w.r.t push notifications, instant updates, faster pages. Pages don't reload. And
also, we can write native mobile apps.

Hotwire consists of 3 parts:

- Turbo
- Stimulus
- Strada

They all are inter related, but Strada is something which can elevate the whole
information to the next level. I'm not sure if generators make sense here.

One way is to explore it.
