# Merge Helper

One of the important things about PR reviews is to get feedback from colleagues.
It is good to have PR reviews so that colleagues can learn from each other.
Please note that this is no place for bikeshedding. Trunk based dev, believing
and trusting colleagues fall into that category

Whenever a PR is merged, all the discussions will be in the PR but not in git
history. A simple merge helper can collate all the discussions and commit it as
part of git commit message. This will be very helpful when using plain git tools
for searching.
