# Documentation

We need a tool like Notion or a simple markdown which can be used to document
how to populate and use collection types. As the number of collections grow,
it becomes very hard to teach content folks how to use those collections.

With some proper documentation that can be easily accessible, we can easily
provide relevant information to the content folks.

It is also possible that we can introduce AI which can easily replace this tool
