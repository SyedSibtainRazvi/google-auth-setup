# Project KickOff

When starting a new project, it's important to take the time to understand all of their requirements, even the ones that aren't written down. This way, you can ensure that you have a complete understanding of what needs to be done in order to succeed. Jumping right into a project without this understanding can make things difficult and cause problems down the line.

Regardless of whether the project is internal or external, the project kickoff is an opportunity to establish common goals and clarify the purpose of the work. This is a critical step for any project, no matter how simple or complex it is. Ultimately, it comes down to ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

## Here is a list of steps we can take before beginning work on a project:

- Initialize a git repository.
- Integrate CSS Library.
- Integrate EsLint and Prettier.
- Integrate Testing library like JEST.
- Integrate Storybook.
- Integrate Vistual testing like Chromatic.
- Set up CI/CD Pipeline.
  - Run actions for Linting check
  - Run actions for Build pass
  - Run actions for Container Scanning
  - Run actions for Dependency Scanning
  - Set up Brakeman
- Integrate Performance Monitoring.
- Integrate Error Tracing like sentry.
- Integrate Analytics.
- Integrate Security Framework.
