Bounded Mars Rover
==================

We're going to make our rovers more intelligent this time.
If the rover gets an "M" command which would push the rover
outside the plateau, the rover ignores this "M" command.

Now let's try the exercise with 3 rovers and the following inputs :

## Input

```
5 5
1 2 N
LMLMLMLMM
3 3 E
MMRMMRMRRM
3 1 E
MRMLMRMLMLLMLMRRM
```

## Output

```
1 3 N
5 1 E
4 1 N
```
