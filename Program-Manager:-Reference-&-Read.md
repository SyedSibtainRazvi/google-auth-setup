- Close the project 


## Initiate Project: 
 - Define the project goals 
 - Determine the resource, people and other projects details.
 - get project approval 

During the project initiation phase, project managers define project goals to clarify the details of a project. They also need to determine resources, people, and project details and get project approval from decision makers at the company. 

### Things to do:
Initiate the project
In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:
    - Who are the stakeholders?
    - What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
    - What is the purpose and mission of the project?
    - What are the measurable objectives for the team?
    - What is the project trying to improve? 
    - When does this project need to be completed? 
    - What skills and resources will the project require? 
    - What will the project cost? What are the benefits?


## Planning project: 
- create a Budget 
- set the schedule 
- Establish your team 
- Determine roles & responsibilities 
- Plan for risk & change 
- Establish communications 

### Things to do:
Make a plan
In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 
    - Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  
    - Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.


Executing: 

- Manage progress 
- Communicate (over always) 
- Make adjustments 

To manage project progress, project managers oversee the team's efforts and make sure everyone understands what's expected of them and how and when to complete key tasks. In this phase, project managers also make needed adjustments and communicate with the team and stakeholders. 

### Things to do:
In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action. 
    - Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
    - Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
    - Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
    - Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
    - Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

- Confirm acceptance of the project outcome.
- Reflect on lessons learnt (retro) 
- communicate results with your stakeholder(interested in and or affected by project completion or success)  
- celebrate the project (email the effort for the company). 

### Things to do:
In this phase, close out the project.

Project management methodologies: 
A project management methodology is a set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle. The method can be linear (with one task completed before the next can begin) or iterative (with some tasks happening at the same time).
- Linear  (eg: building house) - Waterfall method
- Iterative (eg: TV shows) - Agile method

Lean six sigma approach:
- Define
- Measure 
- Analyze 
- Improve 
- Control 

Lean methodology is often referred to as Lean Manufacturing because it originated in the manufacturing world. The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.  
- Lack of proper documentation
- Lack of process standards
- Not understanding the customers’ needs
- Lack of effective communication
- Lack of process control
- Inefficient process design
- Failures of management
Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits. Use 5s system. 
    Sort: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. 
    Set in order: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. 
    Shine: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.
    Standardize: Perform the process in the same way every time. 
    Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.

## Six Sigma

Six Sigma is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.

The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:
    Always focus on the customer.
    Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.
    Make your processes flow smoothly.
    Reduce waste and concentrate on value.
    Stop defects by removing variation.
    Involve and collaborate with your team.
    Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.
