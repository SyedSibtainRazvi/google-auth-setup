# Testing 
###   What Is Testing ?
In general, testing is a process that determines whether or not objectives have been met and the given requirement has been satisfied. It's an execution of the system to identify the errors (bugs) or the missing requirement. Testing is used to measure the specification, functionality, and performance of a program or application, not solely to detect bugs. Testing helps to find defects and bugs, but also at finding measures to improve the application or a website in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and usability. 
 
###  Why Testing?
- Identify bugs as soon as feasible and ensure that they are fixed.
- Study the application functionality in detail to find where the bugs are likely to occur.
- Create test cases in such a way that testing is done to uncover the hidden bugs ensure the application is usable and reliable. 
- To reduce risk to both user and the company.
- To improve performance.


### Types of Testing 
- Manual 
- Automation 

### Manual testing 
Manual testing is a process of manually testing the application or a program for defects and bugs. In this process, the test cases are executed manually according to the end-user perspective without the usage of any automated tool. It checks whether the application is functioning as specified in the requirement document  This manual testing takes a considerable amount of time and work to ensure a bug-free report. Even the Test case reports are also generated manually. 

### How Manual testing works?
After the tester has examined the requirement document to ensure that it encompasses all of the customer's needs, the tester creates test cases in accordance with the document and has the test cases evaluated by the client or team. The tester will next run the test cases and look for bugs. Once an issue has been detected, it should be reported to the developer, and once the bug has been resolved, the tester should retest to ensure that the fixes have been implemented.

### Automation 
Automation testing is a way for executing a test case using automated testing. Test automation is the standard protocol for automatically executing tests, storing test data, and using the findings to enhance the quality of your application. This may be accomplished through the use of test scripts or other automated testing tools. In addition to entering test data into the System Under Test, comparing expected and actual outcomes, and generating thorough test reports, the automated testing tool or program may also enter test data into the System Under Test. Software testing's efficacy, test coverage, and execution speed will all improve as a result of automation testing.
 
### How Automation works?
As a result, we must first specify the automation's aim before proceeding. Once we've decided what kind of testing we'll undertake, we'll need to choose an automated testing tool. Selenium, Selendroid, and Test projects for web apps are some of the open-source technologies available. In the context of automation, we must determine which test cases to automate, which might be influenced by a variety of technical, feasibility, and other considerations. Manually developing test scripts takes a long time, which is why automation is recommended because test scripts and cases may be reused in automation testing. Scripts will be executed during automation, and this execution may be done with the help of an automation tool. The test reports will be generated once the test is performed, and the test reports can be generated automatically.
