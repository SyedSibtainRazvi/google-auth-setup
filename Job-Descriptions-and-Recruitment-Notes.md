##### Github/public API wrapper

```
Use Github's V3 API and create a clean CLI wrapper around it. If you're
not comfortable with CLI apps, then you can try the SDK sort of approach
where your gem/code can be tried out in a PRY/IRB session. It's not required
that you finish everything below.

1. List out all open PRs. Structure of output can be limited to:
2. List of PRs in a mergeable state
3. List of PRs queried by author
4. List of open issues.

For all the above, the output should be limited to the following:
a. Title
b. Author
c. Link
d. ID

Formatting of that output is upto you. Authentication is not needed
since basic Github requests have a rate-limit of 5000 requests per x
minutes.



Bonus:

1. Ability to order those items by date or author name etc.
2. See if you can implement a feature where you can label PRs/issues
   stale based on some criteria.
