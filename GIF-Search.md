Build a UI where you can post a message and see a list of messages posted below it.
You can type in a text and also insert a GIF image by
clicking a button and searching for a GIF. It should work just
like the Facebook's UI as shown here:

The facebook UI has many other things, but you only need the UI for the text input and the gif search.

You can use the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/) to fetch gif using a text string.
You cannot use any JS library other than React.
