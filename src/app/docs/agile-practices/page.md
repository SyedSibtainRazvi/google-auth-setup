We use project management framework called Scrum that provides a structure for fast-paced Agile teams to prioritize, manage, and execute work. All the below process are used to achieve this framework.

## Understanding a Sprint:

Every project will have sprints. A Scrum sprint is a time-boxed period during an ongoing development cycle where a specific set of features or capabilities are worked on. A sprint usually runs for 1 to 4 weeks (2 weeks is an ideal time frame).

### Standup process:
On daily basis we would have standup, where each member in the team would address the below questions

- What is/are the things that you've done yesterday?
- What is the next important thing that you will be working on today?
- Any issue/concern that is blocking your progress?

### Project grooming:

This process in very crucial to understanding what is the next set of tasks that the team will be picking up in the upcoming sprint. During a sprint grooming the project manager will be presenting a list of tickets. SM will run through each of the tickets explain the purpose and details of each feature/bug that needs to be worked on. In case of lack of details on the ticket or if more clarity is required, the team addresses it in the grooming meeting. Later the PM would consider all the recommendations from the team and change the ticket accordingly for the upcoming planning session.

{% callout title="You should know!" %}
Remember to not pick ticket with no clarity or if it waiting on other external factors. Do request your PM to swap it out with a more clear ticket.
{% /callout %}

### Project planning:

Planning will happen at the end of the sprint. During planning the Sprint master will re-iterate on the ticket details and then the team will allocate sprint points to the ticket. Once all the tickets have been assigned sprint points, depending on the velocity of the team sprint value will be determined. This set of tickets will be picked to be worked on in the coming week.

### How to assign sprint points:

Sprint points are assigned based on the complexity of the ticket and we assign Fibonacci numbers to the ticket. Eg: 1,2,3,5,8.. so on to understand the effort the ticket needs.

- Generally when the ticket is an easy task that can be completed within couple of hours or a day. We assign 1 point.
- Ticket with some good amount of work or comparatively difficult will be awarded 2 points.
- Broken down feature tickets are awarded 3 points again based on the complexity of the work involved.
- A Research ticket and a complete feature ticket generally will be around 5 points. (this is quite rare and always should be broken down to multiple smaller tickets)

### Retro:
A retro meeting is conducted after a sprint is completed to understand the progress of the team. This meeting also gives an opportunity for members to discuss the things she/he had learnt durign the sprint or even raise concerns on things that did not go well during the sprint. Below are the questions that would be answered in a retro:

- What went well?
- What  didn't go as planned?
- What did you learn?
- What can be improved?

This meeting also gives an insight on how an individual or a team can improved over period of time. Given all the blockers and hurdles are cleared.
