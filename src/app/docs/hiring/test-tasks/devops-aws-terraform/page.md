Write terraform to spin up below components(Need not be deployed, only code to be written and pushed to the repository as a Pull Request)
1. One VPC
2. One Public Subnet and 1 Private Subnet
3. One EC2 instance in public subnet - Let us call Public EC2
4. One EC2 instance in private subnet - Let us call it Private EC2
5. EC2 instance in public subnet should be accessible to all users on port 22
6. EC2 instance in private subnet should be accessible only via Public EC2 instance
- Feel free to showcase terraform best practices for brownie points
