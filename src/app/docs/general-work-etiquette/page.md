- When you officially start working for the day, you should say "Good morning" on slack. That, kind of signals, you have started working.
- When you are signing off for the day, you should clearly say that you are done for the day. In office, people can see you leaving, so they know you are gone. But when working from home - we have no other way of knowing that other than you telling us that you are signing off for the day.
- When you are going away from keyboard for water/tea, you should say "afk"on slack window.
- Usually "afk" means away for short time and should not be used when you are going away for long time.
- When you are going away for long time, you should say how long you will be gone, you may or may not specify why you are going away.
- You must have internet backup when working from home.
- You must have power backup when working from home.
- In-spite of power and internet backup if you foresee internet or power problems, let rest of team know that you you forsee outages.
- It is naturally expected that, you are responsible for maintaining sanctity of your home-office setup. Since, Codemancers has no control over your home setup, you should be responsible for defining work and home chores boundaries when working from home.
- Learn to communicate asynchronously. Learn to document things you are doing.
- Use gender-neutral words like `team`, `folks`, `here`, `channel` etc instead of `guys`.
- Join Slack channels: #status-updates, #general, #to-read, #random, #website_blog, #training and your corresponding project channel.

{% callout title="You should know!" %}
Work from home is applicable only post 6 months of tenure at Codemancers.
