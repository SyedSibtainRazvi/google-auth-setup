Using ReactJS (or vanilla JS), but without using Jquery, build a typeahead dropdown that renders a list of countries.
The dropdown will have two parts:

1. An input field where the user will enter characters to filter the country names.
2. A dropdown that is dynamically populated with a list of countries after reading the input from the user.

Example: If a user types "In" in the input field, the dropdown should render "India", "Indonesia" and any other countries
that start with "In".

Scoring will be based on the following:

1. Readability of code (coding style, naming, formatting etc)
2. Optimal use of network (avoid unnecessary API calls)
3. User experience (does the user find it snappy and intuitive to use the UI?)

Please feel free to use any freely available country list API, for example : https://restcountries.eu/
