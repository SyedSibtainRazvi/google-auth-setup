1. Pick a promising application from the inbox
2. Schedule a non technical skype call. Set a reminder for the same.
3. Call the candidate. We're looking for the following things during the call:

  * Is the candidate able to communicate properly ?
  * Does the candidate have relevant work experience (Ruby/Rails, JS, Git, etc) ? Walk through previous projects to understand this. We don't want to go deep and measure how good they are at this point.
  * Is the candidate willing to work at Codemancers HQ for a month initially if they join ?
  * Explain what's expected out of this candidate if the person were to join us (OSS work, blogging, play a role in steering the direction of the company). Are they down with it ?
  
  This call should last no more than 30 minutes.
4. If the answer to all points in step 3 is "yes", give an assignment for the relevant work experience. Pick one from [this list](https://github.com/code-mancers/codemancers/wiki/Job-descriptions,-and-recruitment-notes). Better to give this assignment over chat or a call and get an estimated time when you can expect the solution.
5. Evaluate the solution. We are looking for someone who's already great at what they do or someone who can be, with a little training. Move ahead to the next step if the solution is satisfactory. If the quality of the solution is intolerable, reject. If the solution is not that great but just okay, you need to see if the candidate can be better with a little training. Throw in a few pointers, and see how eager the candidate is to make the solution better. Turnaround time is also a deciding factor in this round - if the candidate takes more than a couple of days from the estimated time to get back with the solution, reject unless we have a solid reason. 
6. Ask one other member of our team for availability to do a face-to-face interview or a video call with the candidate. Introduce this team member to the candidate and schedule the interview. The interviewer should set a reminder.
7. Do the face-to-face interview or video chat. This round should answer the following questions:
  * Does the candidate have good hands on experience on the stuff mentioned in the resume ? Throw some questions at the candidate based on work experience shown in the resume to find out.
  * Is the candidate good at analytical thinking ? Read through the solutions for the assignment and throw a few questions based on the solution which can reveal this. You can also pick up a [code kata](http://codekata.com/) and ask to solve it live.
  * Will the candidate fit in to the Codemancers team and culture ? Does the candidate seem motivated enough ? Can we trust this person with a heap of important work ?
8. Interviewers discuss and unanimously decide if we should hire or not.
9. If the verdict is Yes, prepare and send across a Job offer.
10. Get confirmation that the candidate accepts the job offer.
11. Keep following up, atleast once a week to make sure everything's on track till the candidate joins.
