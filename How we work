**How we collaborate:** 


To begin a project, we create a project charter that outlines all the important details. 
This includes information such as the project's purpose, goals, deliverables, team members, stakeholders, and budgeting. 
With the project charter in place, we can then move on to developing an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and subsequent versions of the product.
As different versions of a project are developed, new features, design and enhancements may be requested. 
The project manager is responsible for converting these requests into actionable items by breaking them down into smaller,
manageable tasks or tickets.

**PR review Process** 

- The task will be assigned to the developers once the design implementation is done.
- The developers will open a pull request (PR) for review on the designated channel.
- The PR's deployment link should be tested thoroughly for any bugs or required changes.
- Other developers can review the PR to ensure that everything is ready to go.
- If changes are needed, the reviewing developer can leave a comment for the initial developer to make necessary adjustments.

Staging (Main Branch)

- The PR can be merged by the dev to staging branch 
- The team should be testing out the changes on staging if the changes are been reflected 
- Once we have a headups on staging branch , we will be good for the production deployment 

Production deployment 

- Project Manager plans for production release
- Project Manager creates a ticket for production release
- Devs test changes in staging environment
- Devs raise a PR to production
- Another dev creates a release tag for production release
- Production PR is merged to master
- Deployment to production is done automatically or manually
- Project Manager checks for changes on production
- If there is a bug or changes are not reflecting, PM creates a bug ticket on high priority and assigns it to the developer.
- Production releases are meant to done only on Wednesday 

Bugs 

Once the Project managers or the team members finds a bug on any environment, PM will create a bug ticket.
if the bug is on production the ticket priority will be "High" or "Critical".
if we are facing bug on staging the priority will be "Medium" 
Once the Bug ticket has been created by PM he/she will assign the ticket for the dev to work on the fix 
Once the fix is done , dev will raise a PR , the PM will be testing the deployment link of the PR for the fix 
If the fix is okay and the PR is merged to staging and then deployed to production.
